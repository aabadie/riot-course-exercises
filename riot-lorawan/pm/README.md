# Adding Low Power

## **Goal **
Write an application that periodically sends data and sleeps for reducing
power consumption.

## Instructions
  - Start from application `~/riot-course-exercises/riot-lorawan/sensor`
  - Modify the sender thread so that it triggers a send only after an IPC
    message (`msg_t` type) is received
  - After a LoRaWAN send, configure an RTC alarm 20s later
  - In the RTC alarm callback, send a message to the sender thread
  - Test the application
  - Include `pm_layered.h` and use `pm_set(1)` to put the CPU in STOP mode after
    the RTC alarm is set (check the differences with `pm_set(0)`)
